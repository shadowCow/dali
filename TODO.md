# TODO

## Game2d
- put a dedicated player object in the GameEngine?
  it would be an entity, but with some extra props.
  we would also always get a reference to it.

- finish up the audio system.
need to add an AudioPlayer to the GameEngine.
need to load Audio resources along with image resources.
need to add Audio elements to game entities?
  or otherwise include them in the appropriate place.
need to set up the multiple channels for music, ambience, etc

- finish the MetaGame stuff (main menu, scene transitions, levels, etc)

- ??? maybe not - finish up the custom GridPhysics

- finish up the Persistence system
finish the menu system first so we can test it out
