# TODO

  - add animations
  - add more composites
  - svg transforms behaving strangely? maybe due to canvas width/height/lack-of-view-box
  - canvas transforms require more thought.  you can only set the transform or modify the current transform.  so how to apply nested transforms like a transform on an element in a group that is also transformed - might be tricky.
  - add drawing language
  - polish groups?
  - bezier curve is draw differently in svg vs canvas
